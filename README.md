# VI-PANN
Repository contains supplementary material to the VI-PANN paper including model checkpoints

# Checkpoints
The AudioSet deterministic and flipout checkpoints described in [1] are provided in the `checkpoints` directory. An example of how to utilize the checkpoints for transfer-learning purposes is provided in `transfer_learning.py`. The checkpoints are large, so [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) will need to be installed to obtain them.
